# Comodo
This is a repo with information/files for compiling C programs to an ELF format that the Komodo emulator can load and run

# [Comodo's gone dynamic! ðŸ¥³](./NSSTDLib.md#Dynamic-memory-allocation)

## C file
You will not be able to use anything from the C standard library as it will not be loaded. All the SWIs have changed or been removed by kmd so nothing would work anyway.  
In place of the C standard library is the NSSTDlib documented [here](NSSTDLib.md)

## Cross-compiler
In order to compile the C program you will need a cross-compiler for ARM  
`sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi`

## Compiling
To compile a program without the NSSTDlib run the `runNS.sh` script with "bash <path2runNS.sh>"  
To compile a program with the NSSTDlib run the `runWS.sh` script with "bash <path2runWS.sh>" 

Both scripts require input in the form of `<inputfile0> <inputfile1> ... <inputfilen> -o <outputfile>`  
All includes and libraries will be included in the compilation, to view the specifics of this you can open and edit the bash scripts.

## Loading into Komodo
Once the file has been compiled to an ELF you can just LOAD it in KMD.
If all has gone well the start of the program should be at addr. 0x0 and so you can just reset Komodo and run. You can find the end of the main function by looking for BX R14 in the assembly view.  

## NSSTDlib
Included in the repo is the "not so standard library". 
Information on interacting with these functions can be found in the [nsstdlib.md](NSSTDLib.md).  
To use the nsstdlib include the headerfile at the top of the C file and include the file in the compilation process, described [here](#Compiling)

## Linker script
There are two linkerscripts provided, linkC.lds which is used when linking the NSSTDlib this also gives the startup information on the start of the heap. It formats the outputed elf so that 0x0 should be the start of _start.

The second linkerscript is linkS.lds. This is just used when there is no heap and so only the stack information is provided, along with the elf format.

## krt0, krt1
Also included are two files that are used as the actual entry point of your program, they define a function _start that in both cases sets up the stack pointer and call main. krt0 is used when calling a file that includes the NSSTDlib and so also calls heapCreate to setup the heap with the given start and end memory addresses. It also calls reset after main which will print out the error code of main aswell as call swi 2 to end kmd. The instruction that follows is `mov r15, #0` which mean a program that has run successfully does not need to be reset, you can just use run again.

The krt0/1 object files are what is used in linking, but the arm files are also included.

## Using GCC optimisations
GCC optimisations should work, the krt0/1 and NSSTDlib were excluded from optimisation as from testing it caused some issues with inline assembly, although more testing is to be completed.

## Extra files
Included are some examples that do not use the NSSTDlib along with some that do. They have both their C source file and compiled elf.

## BTS
Within the bash scripts you will find the setup flags for the cross compiler below are some explanations/information about why they are included  

Within RunNS.sh which is the file to run without the standard library
`arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc ${inputfiles[@]} -o $outputfile -nostartfiles -nostdlib -nolibc -nodefaultlibs -mcpu=arm7tdmi -T ${dir}/linkS.lds`
 
This passes the input files and the name for the output file  

`-nostartfiles -nostdlib -nolibc -nodefaultlibs` This will disable all of the C libraries that are usually included, I don't think they're all needed I think some probably cover the rest but I'm not testing it.

`-mcpu=arm7tdmi` This is one of the supported architectures listed [here](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/software/komodo/) under target systems

`-T ${dir}/linkS.lds` This will override the normal linker script. The new script is linkS, for 

Within RunWS.sh which is the file to run with the standard library

`arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc ${inputfiles[@]} -o $outputfile -nostartfiles -nostdlib -nolibc -nodefaultlibs -mcpu=arm7tdmi -T ${dir}/linkC.lds -I${dir}/Includes -L${dir}/Libs -Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch`

`-I${dir}/Includes` This adds an include directory where the NSSTDlib's header file is stored

`-L${dir}/Libs` This adds a lib directory to where the NSSTDlib compiled library can be found

`-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch` disables the warning about redefining the std lib functions

## TODO
I have not yet tried to have multiple C files that are then linked. I think this will work just fine, but it is not yet tested.
